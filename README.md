# Inferring African wild dog behaviour using collar-mounted accelerometers

This repository contains the code and associated files for the research project "Inferring African wild dog behaviour using collar-mounted accelerometers" conducted as part of the requirements for the Mres Biodviersity, Evolution and COnservation at UCL.

## Project Description

This study aims to determine if it is possible to extract new information from low-resolution Vectronics GPS collars by comparing their data to behavioural categories derived and collected simultaneously by DD collars on the same individuals. By establishing relationships between the two collar types, we seek to develop a tool for converting low-resolution GPS data into more detailed behavioural information. Vectronics GPS collars provide location data in space and time, along with a dual-axis accelerometer recording every 5 minutes. In contrast, DD collars feature a multi-sensor archival tag capable of recording triaxial accelerometery 20 times per second, GPS location, as well as multiple other sensory readings.

For this study, the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) are used due to their well-known behaviours and high behavioural synchrony within packs. 

This study aims to address two key research questions:
1)	Can specific behavioural activities (e.g., resting, walking, trotting, running) be accurately inferred from Vectronics GPS collar data using behavioural categories derived from Daily Diary collar data in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus)?
2)	To what extent do African wild dogs within the same pack exhibit behavioural synchrony, and how does this synchrony influence the reliability of using data from one type of collar to infer behaviour recorded by another type of collar?
By answering these questions, this research will provide insight into potential methods for extracting valuable information from lower-resolution biologging devices, ultimately enabling a more comprehensive understanding of African wild dog behaviours in the face of environmental change.

The main findings of the project are as follows:

A significant association was found between activity levels recorded by Vectronics GPS collars and behavioral categories derived from DD collars, with a clear distinction between rest and active behaviors. However, the relationship varied among different pairs of wild dogs, as indicated by significant interaction effects between behavior categories and collar pairs.

Analysis of DD collar data from wild dog pairs wearing the same collar type revealed a high percentage of time engaged in the same behaviors. However, synchrony levels were lower for active behaviors compared to resting behaviors, suggesting individual variation in activity patterns within the same pack. This finding was further supported by paired comparisons of activity levels and behaviors.

Despite limitations, distinguishing between active and non-active behaviors using GPS collar technology proves valuable for understanding the effects of environmental change on African wild dog behavior. Integrating data from old and new collar technologies allows researchers to identify trends in wild dog behaviors while minimizing costs and distress, leading to more efficient conservation strategies.
